It was the Fall '20 project of One Team Coding (of which I'm now a board member). The demo is a part of it written by me - a `Reviews` component that allows users to add reviews on a specific location and vote up/down on the reviews, together with the backend code that implements the APIs used in the component. The frontend is in React.js, while the backend is Express/MongoDB. For the backend files, only parts used in the Reviews component are kept.
